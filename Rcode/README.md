# DP considering contingency table analysis
## Contents
* This folder has R codes for differentially private Goodness-of-fit and independence testing which based on weighted sum of chi-square distribution and gaussian differential privacy (GDP, Dong et al 2021). 
* The tests requires 'mgcv' R package for weighted sum of chi-square distribution. 
* 'data.table' and 'dplyr' R packages are used for convenience of dealing data sets. 'data.table' provides 'fread' and 'fwrite' functions which are much faster than other data reading and writing functions.
